Day 6. Majority Element II 🧠

💡 Problem Description:
You are given an array of integers arr[] where each number represents a vote for a candidate. Return the candidates that have votes greater than one-third of the total votes. If there's no majority vote, return an empty array.

Note: The answer should be returned in an increasing order.

🔍 Example Walkthrough:
Input:
arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output:
[5, 6]

Explanation:
5 and 6 occur more than n / 3 times in the array.

Input:
arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:
[]

Explanation:
No candidate occurs more than n / 3 times.

Code (Python)
class Solution:
    def findMajority(self, arr):
        num1, num2, c1, c2 = None, None, 0, 0
        n = len(arr)
        for x in arr:
            if x == num1:
                c1 += 1
            elif x == num2:
                c2 += 1
            elif c1 == 0:
                num1 = x
                c1 = 1
            elif c2 == 0:
                num2 = x
                c2 = 1
            else:
                c1 -= 1
                c2 -= 1
        c1, c2 = 0, 0
        for x in arr:
            if x == num1:
                c1 += 1
            elif x == num2:
                c2 += 1
        res = []
        if c1 > n // 3:
            res.append(num1)
        if c2 > n // 3:
            res.append(num2)
        res.sort()
        return res
