The problem can be found at the following link: Problem Link

💡 Problem Description:
You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

🔍 Example Walkthrough:
Input:
arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output:
[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]

Explanation:
The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second-last position, and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].

Input:
arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output:
[2, 5, 4]

Explanation:
The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].

Input:
arr = [1]
Output:
[1]

Explanation:
The array has only a single element, hence the reversed array is the same as the original.
