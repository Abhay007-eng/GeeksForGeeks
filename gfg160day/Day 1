🚀 Day 1. Second Largest 🧠
💡 Problem Description:
Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist, return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

🔍 Example Walkthrough:
Input:

arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output:

34
Explanation:
The largest element of the array is 35, and the second largest element is 34.

Input:

arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output:

5
Explanation:
The largest element of the array is 10, and the second largest element is 5.

Input:

arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output:

-1
Explanation:
The largest element of the array is 10, and there is no distinct second largest element.

class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        first = float('-inf')
        second = float('-inf')

        for num in arr:
            if num > first:
                second = first
                first = num
            elif num > second and num < first:
                second = num

        return -1 if second == float('-inf') else second
