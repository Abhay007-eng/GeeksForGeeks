Number of Occurrences 🧠

💡 Problem Description:
Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, determine the number of occurrences of target in the array.

If the number does not exist in the array, return 0.

🔍 Example Walkthrough:
Input:
arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output:
4

Explanation:
2 occurs 4 times in the array.

Input:
arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 4
Output:
0

Explanation:
4 is not present in the array.

SOLUTION

class Solution:
    def countFreq(self, arr, target):
        import bisect
        lower = bisect.bisect_left(arr, target)
        upper = bisect.bisect_right(arr, target)
        return (upper - lower) if lower < len(arr) and arr[lower] == target else 0
